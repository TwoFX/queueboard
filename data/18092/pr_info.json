        "body": "Previously, it's defined to be the range of `algebraMap R A`. In the noncommutative setting, we want to write `1 : Ideal R` where `Ideal R := Submodule R R`, but `R` isn't an `R`-algebra if `R` is not commutative. If we were to introduce a new typeclass by removing the `commutes'` field from `Algebra`, we could keep the current definition, but I'd argue that it's still better to use SMul to define `1 : Submodule R A`, because `Submodule` only depends on the Module/SMul, not on the algebraMap/RingHom.\r\n\r\nRequires fixes in 11 other files.\r\n\r\n---\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.

My motivation was to try and merge `algebraMap` wth `Matrix.scalar`, but it would also give us the canonical map between the groups of units in a tower of algebras etc.\r\n\r\nYeah probably we should do it eventually. @mariainesdff is visiting and when we talked she expressed the desire to have such a class in her work. I told her the [ringHomEquivModuleIsScalarTower](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Algebra/Module/Defs.html#ringHomEquivModuleIsScalarTower) trick but I'm not sure how useful it is. \r\n\r\nI think there will be declarations that only require the SMul, which should only assume Module+IsScalarTower (like here), and declarations that only require the RingHom which should just use the RingHom (not a typeclass). For example, in [Module.Finite.trans](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/9380/files#diff-4366093c72bfc05af273a37b05806a2647588185f43d6dd0d2b06d0c97404227L679-R680) we wouldn't like to switch back to Algebra, even though the assumptions imply that `fun r : R ↦ r • (1 : A)` is a RingHom. So even when we do introduce Algebra without commutes', I don't think we should revert this PR.",

And getting that more generic inclusion to work right seems to be quite hard, so I don't think either we can try to do it in a simple way here and then fix it up later.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I want that consideration to be remembered for future refactors, if we can ever make the inclusion work well. So I think it's okay to merge the PR with the `(· • 1)` definition, if we leave a TODO note and an issue about changing this when we figure out how.",

My motivation was to try and merge `algebraMap` wth `Matrix.scalar`, but it would also give us the canonical map between the groups of units in a tower of algebras etc.\r\n\r\nYeah probably we should do it eventually. @mariainesdff is visiting and when we talked she expressed the desire to have such a class in her work. I told her the [ringHomEquivModuleIsScalarTower](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Algebra/Module/Defs.html#ringHomEquivModuleIsScalarTower) trick but I'm not sure how useful it is. \r\n\r\nI think there will be declarations that only require the SMul, which should only assume Module+IsScalarTower (like here), and declarations that only require the RingHom which should just use the RingHom (not a typeclass). For example, in [Module.Finite.trans](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/9380/files#diff-4366093c72bfc05af273a37b05806a2647588185f43d6dd0d2b06d0c97404227L679-R680) we wouldn't like to switch back to Algebra, even though the assumptions imply that `fun r : R ↦ r • (1 : A)` is a RingHom. So even when we do introduce Algebra without commutes', I don't think we should revert this PR.",

And getting that more generic inclusion to work right seems to be quite hard, so I don't think either we can try to do it in a simple way here and then fix it up later.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I want that consideration to be remembered for future refactors, if we can ever make the inclusion work well. So I think it's okay to merge the PR with the `(· • 1)` definition, if we leave a TODO note and an issue about changing this when we figure out how.",
