Note that \"discConv_discConv\", the key lemma which is `sorry`ed in your treatment, would be automatic in our approach: it is subsumed by the fact that for any abelian group `G` and monoid-with-one `M`, `M â†’ G` is canonically a module over its own endomorphism algebra `Module.End â„¤ (M â†’ G)`, and we can compose this with the natural map from `â„¤[X]` to `Module.End â„¤ (M â†’ G)` sending `X` to the shift-by-1 operator, to obtain a module action of polynomials on `M â†’ G` with `X` acting as the shift. Then Newton-Gregory is just the binomial expansion of `((X - 1) + 1) ^ n`.",

Instead of just considering the shift operator `f â†¦ f (x + 1) - f x`, you could consider more generally `f â†¦ âˆ‘ s, w s â€¢ f (x + s)` (inaccurate notation, see my LeanCamCombi file for the precise one) where `w` is a finsupp. Your proofs should still go through mostly unchanged, but will be more applicable as you can now talk about general composition of shift operators. This is useful to eg show the way shift operators reduce the degree of a polynomial (this was the original purpose of my LeanCamCombi file) and @grhkm21 on Xena just mentioned a number theory statement that needs the shift operator `f â†¦ f (x + s) - f x`.\r\n\r\n> I actually think your treatment could, conversely, benefit from incorporating some ideas from ours (if you intend to pursue it further at any point in future).\r\n\r\nNo plan for now.

Note that \"discConv_discConv\", the key lemma which is `sorry`ed in your treatment, would be automatic in our approach: it is subsumed by the fact that for any abelian group `G` and monoid-with-one `M`, `M â†’ G` is canonically a module over its own endomorphism algebra `Module.End â„¤ (M â†’ G)`, and we can compose this with the natural map from `â„¤[X]` to `Module.End â„¤ (M â†’ G)` sending `X` to the shift-by-1 operator, to obtain a module action of polynomials on `M â†’ G` with `X` acting as the shift. Then Newton-Gregory is just the binomial expansion of `((X - 1) + 1) ^ n`.",

Instead of just considering the shift operator `f â†¦ f (x + 1) - f x`, you could consider more generally `f â†¦ âˆ‘ s, w s â€¢ f (x + s)` (inaccurate notation, see my LeanCamCombi file for the precise one) where `w` is a finsupp. Your proofs should still go through mostly unchanged, but will be more applicable as you can now talk about general composition of shift operators. This is useful to eg show the way shift operators reduce the degree of a polynomial (this was the original purpose of my LeanCamCombi file) and @grhkm21 on Xena just mentioned a number theory statement that needs the shift operator `f â†¦ f (x + s) - f x`.\r\n\r\n> I actually think your treatment could, conversely, benefit from incorporating some ideas from ours (if you intend to pursue it further at any point in future).\r\n\r\nNo plan for now.
