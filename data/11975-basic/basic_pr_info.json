        "body": "Given two `R`-coalgebras `M, N`, we can define a natural comultiplication map \r\n`Δ : M ⊗[R] N → (M ⊗[R] N) ⊗[R] (M ⊗[R] N)` and counit map `ε : M ⊗[R] N → R` induced by the comultiplication and counit maps of `M` and `N`. These `Δ, ε` are declared as linear maps in `TensorProduct.instCoalgebraStruct` in `Mathlib.RingTheory.Coalgebra.Basic`.\r\n\r\nIn this PR we show that `Δ, ε` satisfy the axioms of a coalgebra, and also define other data in the monoidal structure on `R`-coalgebras, like the tensor product of two coalgebra morphisms as a coalgebra morphism.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe keep the linear maps underlying `Δ, ε` and other definitions in this PR syntactically equal to the corresponding definitions for tensor products of modules in the hope that this makes life easier. However, to fill in Prop fields, we use the API in #11974. That PR defines the monoidal category structure on coalgebras induced by an equivalence with comonoid objects in the category of modules, `CoalgebraCat.instMonoidalCategoryAux`, but we do not declare this as an instance - we just use it to prove things in this PR and #11976.\r\n\r\nI really don't know how necessary this roundabout approach is; I was just pleased to have got it working. The idea was to use category theory to get non-category theory API for free-ish, without performance issues or the category theory leaking through.\r\n\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.
