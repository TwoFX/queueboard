It's `IsClosed {x : Iio o | x.1 ∈ A}`. We shouldn't write this kind of thing all the time so that's why I think it warrants a definition.

              "body": "I had a quick look through the discussion in #14060, but the conclusion there seems to be that we should define these things topologically anyway? That is, it seems more sensible to re-use IsClosed from the order topology on ordinals, and have a lemma saying it's closed in the topology sense iff `∀ p < o, (o ≠ 0 ∧ ∀ p < o, (S ∩ Ioo p o).Nonempty) → p ∈ S`.\r\nI guess the idea is that that lemma will be pretty awkward to work with, and IsAcc is useful to have anyway... So I'm happy to have IsAcc, but I'm not convinced about Ordinal.IsClosed. What do you think @vihdzp? In any case, let's definitely add the TODO to show this is equivalent to the topology thing.",

              "body": "The issue is that we want to talk about sets of ordinals being closed \"below an ordinal\". That is, we have a set `s : Set Ordinal` and we talk about it being closed below `o`, rather than having a set `s : Set (Iio o)` be closed. So the conversion between these definitions and the topological ones isn't quite so clean as it might seem. The topological equivalences are still useful to have, but I do think it's alright having two different predicates like this.",

              "body": "> I had a quick look through the discussion in #14060, but the conclusion there seems to be that we should define these things topologically anyway? That is, it seems more sensible to re-use IsClosed from the order topology on ordinals, and have a lemma saying it's closed in the topology sense iff `∀ p < o, (o ≠ 0 ∧ ∀ p < o, (S ∩ Ioo p o).Nonempty) → p ∈ S`. I guess the idea is that that lemma will be pretty awkward to work with, and IsAcc is useful to have anyway... So I'm happy to have IsAcc, but I'm not convinced about Ordinal.IsClosed. What do you think @vihdzp? In any case, let's definitely add the TODO to show this is equivalent to the topology thing.\r\n\r\nLike vi said, the topological equivalent isn't as simple as we hoped because it talks about the topology of `Iio o`, not `Ordinal`. It's `IsClosed {x : Iio o | x.1 ∈ A}`. We shouldn't write this kind of thing all the time so that's why I think it warrants a definition. I already have the topological equivalences for both somewhere and I'll PR them when this gets merged, but I'll add a TODO anyways in the meantime.",
